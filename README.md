# Tiger Bush Stripes Analysis and Simulation

In this assignment, we will analyze and simulate the formation of so-called Tiger bush Stripes.

Tiger bushes are patterns of vegetation that resemble the stripes on the fur of a tiger. They can occur for many vegetation types and in many soil types. In semiarid regions, these patterns are seen on hillsides with a very gradual slope. 

A minimal model for tiger bush formation is described by the following set of partial differential equations (PDEs):

```latex
\[
\begin{align*}
\frac{{\partial v}}{{\partial t}} &= \frac{{\partial^2 v}}{{\partial x^2}} - \gamma v + wv^2 \\
\frac{{\partial w}}{{\partial t}} &= \beta\frac{{\partial w}}{{\partial x}} + \alpha - w - wv^2 \\
\end{align*}
\]
